// of the runs themselves older than this are auto-deleted nightly. E.g. on Aug 20,
// keeps Aug 14-20; on Aug 21 the window shifts and Aug 14 is the one that gets
// dropped. Deliberate: this app only needs recent history for Reconciliation (7-day
// trailing average) and day-of Sold Out lookups; unbounded retention is what caused a
// hosting provider's disk to fill up entirely. SyncLog is on the same window because
// the 5-minute Sales/Purchase crons write one row per outlet per run — ~9k rows a day,
// which had grown to 45 MB, larger than every other table combined.
// Sales/Item Sales/Reports pages will only ever show this trailing window.

 * Nightly cleanup only — deletes data older than DATA_RETENTION_DAYS. No trailing-
 * window resync here anymore (Sales/Purchase cron handlers now cover today+yesterday
 * on every 5-min run, so late corrections are already caught without a separate pass).
 *
 * Writes its own SyncLog row (outletId: null) rather than using runSync(), since this
 * is a single global operation, not a per-outlet one — that's what makes it show up in
 * the Settings > Sync Schedule "Recent Sync Runs" table when triggered manually.
